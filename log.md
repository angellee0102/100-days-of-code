# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started Todolist project, and add Clear finished task button, and count how many elements are in the list.

**Thoughts:** I started my todolist using sample code from w3schools. Then I wanted to add my own features, such as counting how many items are, and delete tasks that have been done. I struggled with Javascript, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.
